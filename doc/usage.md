Create a graph from the [template](../graphs/templateLocation/templateGraph/0.0/templateGraph.yaml) and store it in `graphs/sharedDevelopment`
```bash
$ createGraph sharedDevelopment mygraph
$ ls graphs/sharedDevelopment/
mygraph
```

Create a load script for your graph
```bash
$ touch ./graphs/sharedDevelopment/mygraph/0.0/load.sh
$ chmod +x ./graphs/sharedDevelopment/mygraph/0.0/load.sh
```

Create a run script for your graph
